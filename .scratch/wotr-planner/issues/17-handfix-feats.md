## Question

Stage of the split extraction (user, 2026-11-01). Resolve the `## Feats` section of `game-data/EXTRACTION_REPORT.md` by editing the RON files directly. AFK.

- **Files you may edit:** `game-data/feats.ron` only. Plus the report's `## Feats` section.
- **Focus:** Unparsed prerequisite lines (OR, "One of / Two of", misspelt labels, class features, caster/spell level), wrong categories, and missing or extra feats vs the guide's `feats` page.

**Shared rules for the hand-fix stages** (these four run in parallel, one agent each):
- **Your area:** fix only this stage's section of `game-data/EXTRACTION_REPORT.md`, and only this stage's files (below). Other agents are editing the other files at the same time.
- **Source:** the saved pages in `guide-cache/`. Never fetch GameFAQs or any site.
- **Copyright:** commit facts only (names, numbers, prerequisites, keys, anchors). A `summary` stays empty unless it's one short line in your own words.
- **Validating:** use the database-free check command from ticket 10's Answer. Never seed, reset or migrate the dev database; the main session seeds once all stages are done. No schema or `rules` type changes. Anything that needs one becomes a proposed follow-up in your Answer.
- **Unclear items:** anything you can't resolve accurately from the guide stays in the report, with a note on why. Don't guess.
- **Done when:** your section of the report holds only unresolvable items, the check command passes, `cargo test --workspace` passes, and there are no commits.
- **Recording:** append an `## Answer` with fixed and remaining counts and the follow-ups, set `Status: resolved`, and add one line at the end of map.md's Decisions so far using Edit. Keep a dated `## Progress log`, because runs can be cut off.
